    # `includes` tells Rails what associations we're going to be using in
    # our view. This is important, since normally when you call `.comments`
    # on a post, Rails will make a call to the database. If you have a large
    # number of posts, this can cause a huge number of DB requests.

    # Remember, params stores everything sent to the server through form or
    # querystring data. By default, `form_for` will place your data in `params[:model_name]`
    @post = current_user.posts.build(params[:post])

    # This idiom is very common in create and update actions. `save` will return
    # false if the record is invalid. We render `new` rather than redirecting so
    # that the model state, errors and all, remains intact.
